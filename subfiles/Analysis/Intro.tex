\chapter{CERN Use Case}
\label{PICORV32_anal}
In this chapter, a description of one of the LHC detectors at CERN is given, as to give a better understanding of the environment and setting in which the SoC is planned to function. Following this, a theoretical outline is given for radiation and its effects on CMOS electronics and how this can be mitigated by design choice. Following this, an method for extensive verification of individual block and system verification is presented. After this a description of the steps of physical implementation is given and finally the choice of CPU for the SoC is made, which is accompanied by a description of the state of the system at the beginning of the author's internship and the future plans for it.
