abstract = {Solar proton events having a flux of >10 MeV protons ≥10 [cm2-sec-ster]−1 typically occur during the years around solar sunspot maximum. Using >10 MeV solar proton data acquired at the earth for the 19th–21st solar cycles we find that approximately one third of the events occur on the rising portion of the cycle, one third during a two-to-three year period after sunspot maximum, and one third during the remainder of the cycle. The 22nd solar cycles has been an exception with more than twice as many events during the two years following solar maximum as during the rising portion of the cycle. In addition, as of July 1994, there have been relatively few solar proton events during the final decline of cycle 22. A terminal episode of major solar proton events that typically occurs several years after solar maximum, such as those events of July 1961, August 1972 and April 1984 has not yet been observed during the 22nd cycle which, as of July 1994, now appears to be rapidly approaching solar minimum. A comparison will be made of the energetic solar proton events that occurred during the declining portion of the past three solar cycles with those that have occurred during the decline of the present 22nd solar cycle.}

abstract = {A model for the differential energy spectra of galactic cosmic radiation as a function of solar activity is described. It is based on the standard diffusion-convection theory of solar modulation. Estimates of the modulation potential based on fitting this theory to observed spectral measurements from 1954 to 1989 are correlated to the Climax neutron counting rates and to the sunspot numbers at earlier times taking into account the polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field at the time of observations. These regression lines then provide a method for predicting the modulation at later times. The results of this model are quantitatively compared to a similar Moscow State University (MSU) model. These model cosmic ray spectra are used to predict the linear energy transfer spectra, differential energy spectra of light (charge ≤ 2) ions, and single event upset rates in memory devices. These calculations are compared to observations made aboard the Space Shuttle.}

abstract = {By technology down scaling in nowadays digital circuits, their sensitivity to radiation effects increases, making the occurrence of soft errors more probable. As a consequence, soft error rate estimation of complex circuits such as processors is becoming an important issue in safety- and mission-critical applications. Fault injection is a well-known and widely used approach for soft error rate estimation. Development of previous FPGA-based fault injection techniques is very time consuming mainly because they do not adequately exploit supplementary FPGA tools. This paper proposes an easy-to-develop and flexible FPGA-based fault injection technique. This technique utilizes debugging facilities of Altera FPGAs in order to inject single event upset (SEU) and multiple bit upset (MBU) fault models in both flip-flops and memory units. As this technique uses FPGA built-in facilities, it imposes negligible performance and area overheads on the system. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is on average four orders of magnitude faster than a pure simulation-based fault injection. These features make the proposed technique applicable to industrial-scale circuits.}

abstract = {By technology down scaling in nowadays digital circuits, their sensitivity to radiation effects increases, making the occurrence of soft errors more probable. As a consequence, soft error rate estimation of complex circuits such as processors is becoming an important issue in safety- and mission-critical applications. Fault injection is a well-known and widely used approach for soft error rate estimation. Development of previous FPGA-based fault injection techniques is very time consuming mainly because they do not adequately exploit supplementary FPGA tools. This paper proposes an easy-to-develop and flexible FPGA-based fault injection technique. This technique utilizes debugging facilities of Altera FPGAs in order to inject single event upset (SEU) and multiple bit upset (MBU) fault models in both flip-flops and memory units. As this technique uses FPGA built-in facilities, it imposes negligible performance and area overheads on the system. The experimental results show that the proposed technique is on average four orders of magnitude faster than a pure simulation-based fault injection. These features make the proposed technique applicable to industrial-scale circuits.}
